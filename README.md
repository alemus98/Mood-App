# Mood App
## Project Description
For this project, we were asked to create a full-stack application using React in the front end and MongoDB and express in the backend. We decided to create a mood tracking application that lets you reflect on your past moods and why you were feeling the way you were on a certain day/time, to better know how to create more consistent habits in the future. 
## Acceptance Criteria
WHEN user logs in with username and password
THEN it prompts the user to select a mood option
WHEN user selects a mood option
THEN a pop up appears asking user to log what is making them feel that way
WHEN user enters why they selected the particular mood
THEN a card pops up with solutions/antidotes corresponding to that mood
WHEN the user navigates to the profile tab
THEN they are given records of their past mood choices, what day and time they selected their past mood, and the description they gave as to why the were feeling that way at the time.
## Motivation
Our motivation behind Mood App was to create a simplified version of an everyday journal that allows you to quickly log how you are feeling on any given day, why you were feeling that way, and when you submitted that information. The user can then access their past choices at anytime and analyse patterns in their past that cause their mood to be positive or negative. As an added bonus to the application, when the user choices a mood for the day, they are presented with a randomly generated quote or fun fact to help lift their spirits if they are feeling down, or reinforce their good mood when they are feeling happy.
